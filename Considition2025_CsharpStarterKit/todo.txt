Charge less to gain time

score function with distance

longer shedule?

When charging (for low energy maps)
	- calc min level to reach
	- then set a value to charge to depenging on config
	- try different values and select the best one

Look at awailable energy in different zones.
	- Select from current and next zone.
	- Prefer when charging is faster.
	- Disregard if energy is low

Check why some cars runs out.
	- Probably cause it cant even reach nearest charger.
	Disregard routing to stations that are to far away even if the combined path is the shortest.

Save a tick by not doing last charge?
	- It seams better to find a ballance since charging gives score.
